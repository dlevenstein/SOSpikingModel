# SOSpiking Model

This project is the Slow Oscillation Spiking Model (SOSpiking Model). The purposes of this project is to model NREM slow wave oscillations during NREM sleep with a spiking neural network. 

Change directories to `SOSpikingModel/AnalysisScripts` and run this code: 

``` 
>>TestSOSpikingModel
Input the directory path of the SOSpikingModel folder: '/home/GitHub/SOSpikingModel'
```

This would run a test training simulation of a network of spiking neurons.
